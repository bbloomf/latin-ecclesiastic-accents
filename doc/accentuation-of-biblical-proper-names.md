Here you have some interim rules for the latin accentuation of biblical proper names.

• -ia, -ias (in the sense of "the Lord"):
Accent the penultimate:
Abía, Zacharías, Barachías

• Beth- (in the sense of "house"):
If the 'e' is the antepenultimate, 'Beth-' seems to attract the accent on the 'e' (or to make short the penultimate, which boils down to the same thing). So accent the antepenultimate:
Béthlehem, Béthsimoth, Béthoron

• Eli- (in the sense of "my God"):
- If the 'i' is the antepenultimate, 'Eli-' seems to attract the accent on the 'i' (or to make short the penultimate, which boils down to the same thing). So accent the antepenultimate:
Elímelech, Elísabeth, Elíada, Elíacim
- If the 'i' is the penultimate, it is long. In this case accent the penultimate:
Elísa

• -iel (in the sense of "of God"):
The 'i' of 'iel' is short, so accent the antepenultimate:
Gábriel, Dániel, Ariel

• -aim:
The 'a' of 'aim' is short, so accent the antepenultimate:
Ephraim, Ramáthaim, Sephárvaim

• Melchi- (in the sense of "king of"):
- If the 'i' is the antepenultimate, 'Melchi-' seems to attract the accent on the 'i' (or to make short the penultimate, which boils down to the same thing). So accent the antepenultimate:
Melchísedech, Melchísua
- If the 'i' is the penultimate, it is long. In this case accent the penultimate:
Melchíram

• Ahi- (in the sense of "brother of"):
- If the 'i' is the antepenultimate, 'Ahi-' seems to attract the accent on the 'i' (or to make short the penultimate, which boils down to the same thing). So accent the antepenultimate:
Ahíalon, Achítophel
- If the 'i' is the penultimate, it is long. In this case accent the penultimate:
Ahíra

• -ezer (in the sense of "help"):
The first 'e' is long, so accent the penultimate:
Eliézer

• -ee:
The first 'e' is long, so accent the penultimate:
Bersabée, Gabée

• -abad (in the sense of "servant"):
The 'a' is short, so accent the antepenultimate:
Iózabad, Iézabad

• -ath, -eth, -ith seem to make short the penultimate, so accent the antepenultimate:
Básemath, Iósabeth, Sálomith
