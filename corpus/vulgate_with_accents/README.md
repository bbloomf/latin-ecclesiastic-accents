Here you have an accented version of the old Vulgate.

• The original text, which has been used for this work, is available here:

	http://www.wilbourhall.org/pdfs/vulgate.pdf

• The accentuation has been performed magna ex parte with Collatinus:

• The result has been checked with:

	- The Polyglotte of Vigouroux (not always consistent, and containing many typographic mistakes):

	- 'A key to the classical pronunciation of Greek, Latin, and Scripture Proper Names' by John Walker (1807) (not always concordant with the Ecclesiastic accentuation):
