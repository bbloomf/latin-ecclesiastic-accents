## Collatinus

This folder contains the raw data of [Collatinus](https://github.com/biblissima/collatinus) (models and lemmes) and a Python script that transforms them into JSON Objects in the global data file 'data.txt'.

This data file, after, can easily be splitted and sorted (for example in a spreadsheet) to get the data files contained in accenteur/data/ folder.
