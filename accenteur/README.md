## Accenteur

Accenteur is a web app written in Javascript to accentuate latin texts according to the liturgical rules in force in the Roman Catholic Church.

Its algorithms and data were adaptated from [Collatinus](https://github.com/biblissima/collatinus).

Its name comes from the french name of a little mountain bird: the Alpine Accentor (*Prunella collaris*).


# Thanks

Thanks to Philippe Verkerk from Collatinus for its counsels, patience and encouragements.
