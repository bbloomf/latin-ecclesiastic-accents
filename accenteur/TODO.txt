- J/I:
  • injicio, abjicio etc.
  • iniuriam
  • convert j to i and retry.
  • convert i to j and retry.

- Overlay "please wait" for big texts.

- From the usability POV, it would be nice if for the words where there are two possibilities of accent one could make a choice once for all such words in the text, e.g. in the psalms there are hundreds of occurrences of Domine where one wants to use Dómine all the time, never Domíne.

- If input accented, only check.

- Errors:
praesta
cœli
coeli
