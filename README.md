# latin-ecclesiatic-accents

This repository contains resources for ecclesiastic accentuation.

The goal is to have some documentation about accentuation for prose, and a corpus of accentuated hymns, as these cannot be accented automatically.


## Resources

- [doc/accentuation-rules.md](doc/accentuation-rules.md) contains the rules for accentuating prose
- [corpus/](corpus) contains a corpus of accentuated texts


## Thanks

This work would not have been possible without the following persons/institutions:

- the Abbey of Flavigny (FR), for having the project started
- the Abbey of Solesmes (FR), for advises and providing the accentuated proofread psalms
- M. Gérard Gréco and the whole team behind the 2016 Edition of the Gaffiot Latin-French dictionnary, whose help was fundamental
- M. Philippe Verkerk and M. Yves Ouvrard, for helping us directly and through [collatinus](http://outils.biblissima.fr/collatinus/)
- Jakub Jelinek, for his great help on corpus treatment
- the Abbey of Le Barroux (FR)
